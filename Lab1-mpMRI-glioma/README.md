# Lab 1: Brain imaging (mpMRI) in glioma &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span style="font-size: 16px;">[ELMED219 + BMED365]</span>

This lab will give an example-based introduction to multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) of brain tumor (glioma), using Python and toolkits for computational medical imaging and analysis.

## Your turn!

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebooks. If you're already familiar with medical imaging and image analysis you can try your hand at more advanced examples, or, even better, help out other less experienced team members.


#### Jupyter notebooks

:question: As Jupyter Notebook is quite new to many of you, you may want to skim through some tutorials. Here are two (also linked under "Getting Started" at MittUiB):
