### How to get started?

You can read the Lab2-DL materials on any device but this course is best viewed and coded along within a desktop browser.

The course uses a free tool called Google Colab. If you've got no experience with it, go through the free Introduction to [Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) and then come back here.

To start with Pytorch and tensors:

- Click on link ["00. PyTorch Fundamentals"](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals)
- Click the "Open in Colab" button up the top
- Press SHIFT+Enter a few times and see what happens
