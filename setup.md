## Are you using Linux?
Then you are likely familiar with the command line (shell) and can modify the installation procedures described for MacOS. 



## Notes on the command line (shell) and notebooks: 

#### On Mac, Windows and Linux we will use the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) (shell)
See e.g. [Basic Unix Commands](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/pcfb/unix.html) and [Computing Skills for Biologists](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com) [[here](https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB)] if this is unfamiliar to you. See also the
[Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) lessons (thanks to [Anne Fouilloux](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/adm/annefou), UiO)

#### ... and luckily also the [Jupyter notebook](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1)
- for openness [!](https://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) and reproduciblity [!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08055.pdf)

## Notes on GitHub:
The course code is hosted on the code-sharing platform GitHub (where you now are reading this). If you do not have a GitHub account already you should make one now (https://github.com/join). We recommend that you are using the platform for your own projects during the course. Hence:


- Create an account on GitHub (https://github.com) using the `Sign up for GitHub` form on the right side of the page.
- Send your GitHub username to your instructor.
- Once your instructor adds you to the course GitHub organization you will receive an email asking you to accept the invitation. Click on the link to accept.
- Check if this worked
  - Go to https://github.com.
  - Sign in if necessary.
  - In the upper left corner click on the drop down with your name.
  - Confirm that the name of the course GitHub organization is present

## Notes on Anaconda:
We recommend installing Python via the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Be sure to use the "Python 3.11.x" version. We will use the Conda Package Management System within the Anaconda Distribution. From the [documentation](https://conda.io/docs):
> Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer.

After the installation run `python --version` in a terminal window (in "Anaconda Prompt" if you are using Windows). If the output show "Python 3.8.x" (and "Anaconda") you are good to go.


## Notes on Colab:
Alternatively, some of the Jupyter notebooks in the Labs can be executed on **Google Colaboratory**. Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs. Colab is free to use, and resources are not guaranteed and not unlimited, and the usage [resource limits](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#resource-limits) sometimes fluctuate.

Colab ode is executed in a virtual machine private to your account, i.e.

> you will need to [Create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) if you not already have one (you don't need a Gmail account to create a Google Account as you can use your non-Gmail address).

Virtual machines are deleted when idle for a while, and have a maximum lifetime enforced by the Colab service.

Colab notebooks are stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive), or can be loaded from [GitHub](https://github.com). Colab notebooks can be shared just as you would with Google Docs or Sheets. Simply click the Share button at the top right of any Colab notebook, or follow these Google Drive [file sharing instructions](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

<img src="./assets/You.png" width="100"> <br>
_I prefer to use COLAB in the course. Please provide information about colab and how to proceed. What about using my own notebooks and data?_

<img src="./assets/GPT-MedAI.png" width="370"> <br>
Using Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is a great choice for working on the ELMED219 course, especially if you prefer an environment that doesn't require local setup for Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Here's an overview and guidance on how to use Google Colab, including working with your own notebooks and data.

### What is Google Colab?
- **Overview:** Google Colab is a free, cloud-based service that provides a Jupyter notebook environment. It allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with zero configuration required, free access to GPUs, and easy sharing.
- **Benefits:**
  - No setup: Run notebooks with no installation required.
  - Free access to GPUs: Useful for machine learning tasks.
  - Easy sharing: Just like Google Docs, you can share your Colab notebooks with others.
- **Environment:** Colab runs notebooks on Google Cloud, meaning you can leverage their hardware (including GPUs and TPUs) and save your work on Google Drive.

### Getting Started with Google Colab
1. **Access Colab:**
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - You'll need a Google account to use Colab.

2. **Create a New Notebook:**
   - Click on `New Notebook` to create a new notebook.
   - Alternatively, you can go to `File` > `Open notebook` to open existing notebooks from Google Drive, GitHub, or upload from your computer.

3. **Interface Familiarization:**
   - The interface is similar to Jupyter Notebook. It has a menu bar, a toolbar, and cells where you can write and execute code or add text.

### Using Your Own Notebooks and Data
- **Uploading Notebooks:**
  - You can upload your Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) directly to Colab from your local machine or integrate with GitHub to load notebooks.

- **Using Data:**
  - **From Local Machine:** You can upload files from your local machine using:
    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()
    ```
  - **From Google Drive:** Mount your Google Drive to access files stored there:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```
    This allows you to access files stored in Google Drive directly from your Colab notebooks.
  - **From External Sources:** You can also download data from external sources directly to Colab using `!wget [URL]` command or Python's requests library.

### Running Code
- **Execute Cells:** Click the play button on the left of the code cell or use `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
- **GPU/TPU Access:** For tasks requiring heavy computation, you can access GPUs/TPUs by going to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and selecting your preferred hardware accelerator.

### Saving and Sharing Work
- **Auto-save:** Colab automatically saves your notebooks to your Google Drive.
- **Sharing:** Share your notebooks just like a Google Doc by clicking the `Share` button and adding collaborators.

### Additional Features
- **Version Control:** Colab supports version history, allowing you to see previous versions of your notebook.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on a notebook simultaneously, just like Google Docs.

### Tips for Using Colab in Your Course
- **Regular Backups:** While Colab auto-saves to Drive, it's a good practice to keep local backups of important notebooks.
- **Internet Dependency:** Since Colab is cloud-based, you'll need a stable internet connection to use it.
- **Session Limits:** Be aware that Colab sessions are limited (runtime and GPU usage), and you might lose your session if you're inactive for too long or exceed usage limits.

Google Colab is an efficient and powerful tool for working on machine learning and data science projects, making it suitable for your ELMED219 course. It allows you to focus on learning and coding without worrying about your local environment setup. If you have specific needs or run into any issues, feel free to seek further assistance.

## Install and test your course environment

After you have successfully installed Anaconda, Git, VS Code, and cloned the ELMED219 corse repository (see above): 

### Test your installation:
Inspect and run the notebook [`0.0-test-installation.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMIVML/ELMED219/blob/main/Lab1-mpMRI-glioblastoma/Lab-optional-imaging/00-test-installation.ipynb) in the `Lab1-mpMRI-glioblastoma/Lab-otional-imaging` directory:
```bash
cd Lab1-mpMRI-glioblastoma/Lab-otional-imaging
jupyter notebook  (or, jupyter lab, or, code . )
```


## Update:
The code and environment will be updated during the course. Run the following commands regularly:
* Update code: `git pull`
* Update environment:
```bash
conda activate elmed219
conda env update
```

## Unix Shell

Learners need to understand what files and directories are and what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the
[Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) lessons (thanks to [Anne Fouilloux](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/adm/annefou), UiO)

## Programming with Python

The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so [this](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: **data analysis** ("... _we are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis, and need to analyze the first dozen data sets of their daily inflammation_ ..."); see also [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation).


## A note on R (tip for previous R users)

**It is possible to run R-scripts in Jupyter notebooks**  (Jupyter = Julia, Python and R).

If you want to continue working with R (*not part of this course*) you should:

- Be using the latest R version (https://www.r-project.org) and the RStudio Desktop [[download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download)] for your Windows, MacOS or Linux system.
- **Install the R kernel** by opening an R console and then follow the instructions at https://irkernel.github.io/installation
- Necessary (or new) R libraries should be installed via RStudio and the corresponding R environment.
- See also [here](https://datatofish.com/r-jupyter-notebook) and [here](https://developers.refinitiv.com/article/setup-jupyter-notebook-r).
- The [rpy2](https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2) interface to use R form Python is also possible (but can be a bit more messy).
