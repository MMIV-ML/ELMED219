The [course](https://www.uib.no/en/course/BMED365) is offered by the [Department of Biomedicine](https://www.uib.no/en/biomedisin) (UiB) in collaboration with the [Department of Computer science, Electrical engineering and Mathematical sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/about/management/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/department-of-computer-science-electrical-engineering-and-mathematical-sciences-ny-side) at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), and the Medical AI group at [Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center](https://mmiv.no) (MMIV).

The objective and content of the course address: The computational mindset, imaging, modeling, machine learning, and AI in future medicine, as well as ethical and regulatory aspects of AI. The course is a guided "journey" with a hands-on component through selected computational modeling techniques within biomedical and clinical applications. Examples, demonstrations, and tasks will be related to in vivo imaging (MRI) and segmentation, biomarkers and prediction, network analysis ("patient similarity networks"), multimodal data, as well as large language models ("foundation models") within medicine and health. Throughout the course, students will use principles and modern tools for data analysis, machine learning, and generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) within medical applications. This will give the students an introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks, use of the "cloud" for access to open data, calculations, and knowledge, as well as insight into and rationale for "open science" and "reproducible research". All course material is openly available on this GitHub repository. (See also [BMED365](https://github.com/MMIV-ML/BMED365))


- This repository contains most of the course material. Students enrolled in the course will also find some practical information at [MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/45080).

- On your own, you are encouraged to spend approximately four hours completing at least one DataCamp course (remember to use the link on MittUiB for free access to DataCamp). Which DataCamp course you're encouraged to do depends on your previous programming experience:<br>
  - No Python programming experience? Complete the course [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)<br>
  - Know some Python, but no machine learning? Complete the course [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn)<br>
  - Know the fundamentals of machine learning in Python? Can you pass the *Machine Learning Fundamentals Assessment*? Complete the course [Biomedical Image Analysis in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python)   

-  For **academic questions** about the course, contact course coordinator [Arvid Lundervold](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Arvid.Lundervold) (UiB).

- For **practical or administrative inquiries**, contact the Studies Section at the Department of Biomedicine at studie.biomed@uib.no
