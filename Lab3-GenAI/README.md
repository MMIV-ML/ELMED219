## OpenAI: Prompt engineering guide

This **guide (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)** is highly recommended and shares strategies and tactics for getting better results from large language models like GPT-4. The methods (Six strategies, each with a set of tactics) described in this guide can sometimes be combined for greater effect. Experimentation is encouraged to find the methods that work best for your intentions.

### The Six strategies for getting better results:

- **Write clear instructions** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-write-clear-instructions)]
- **Provide reference text** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-provide-reference-text)]
- **Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-subtasks)]
- **Give the model time to "think"** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-give-models-time-to-think)]
- **Use external tools** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-use-external-tools)]
- **Test changes systematically** [[link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-test-changes-systematically)]
