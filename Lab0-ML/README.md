# Lab 0: Introduction to theory and tools for machine learning

This lab will give a quick example-based introduction to basic ideas in **machine learning**, using Python and *scikit-learn*. <br> We will also introduce elements of **graph theory**, **network science**, and the concept of **patient similarity networks** (PSN) using *NetworkX* - a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

## Your turn! 

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebook. If you're already familiar with machine learning, you can try your hand at more advanced examples or, even better, help out other less experienced team members. Try out the things you learn in the DataCamp courses by modifying and extending the notebook used in this Lab.
