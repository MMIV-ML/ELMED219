As **Jupyter Notebook** is quite new to many of you, you may want to skim through some tutorials. Here are two good starting points:

Short description on the three notesbooks in this Lab0 section.

Last section "10 Minutes to pandas" is a nice and more comprehensive introduction to Pandas.  | [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MMIV-ML/ELMED219/blob/main/Lab0-ML/Lab0-begin-python-pandas-medim/01-begin-pandas-basics.ipynb)<br>

### Your turn! 

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebook. If you're already familiar with Python and Pandas, you can try your hand at more advanced examples (on your own data) or, even better, help out other less experienced team members. Try out the things you learn in the DataCamp courses by modifying and extending the notebook used in this Lab.
