# Experimenting with Your Own Notebooks
- Within the cloned repository, create a new folder, e.g., `MyNotebooks`, for your experiments.
- Make sure to add `MyNotebooks/` to the `.gitignore` file to avoid conflicts with the original repository.
- Develop and test your notebooks in this folder, using the `elmed219` environment.
