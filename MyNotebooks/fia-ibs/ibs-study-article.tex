\section{Background and Current State-of-the-Art}
In exploring the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in IBS, significant strides have been made \citep{smith2023gutbrain, johnson2023mixedmodel, doe2023ibsstudy}. [Further content]

\section{Methods - Linear Mixed Effects Model}
The Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model employed in this study can be mathematically described as follows:
\[ Y_{ij} = X_{ij}\beta + Z_{ij}u_{i} + \epsilon_{ij} \]
where \( Y_{ij} \) represents the response variable (change in brain activity) for the \( i \)-th participant at the \( j \)-th time point, \( X_{ij} \) is the fixed effects design matrix, \( \beta \) is the vector of fixed effect coefficients, \( Z_{ij} \) is the random effects design matrix, \( u_{i} \) is the vector of random effects, and \( \epsilon_{ij} \) is the error term. The model accounts for both the fixed effects of group (IBS vs. Control) and microbiota mean, and the random effects due to individual variations among participants.

\section{Results - Interpretation of the LME Model}
The LME model's findings indicate that while the presence of IBS (p = 0.858) did not significantly affect the change in brain activity, the mean microbiota composition exhibited a statistically significant positive correlation (p = 0.042) with the change in brain activity. This suggests that variations in gut microbiota composition could be a critical factor influencing neurological changes in IBS patients.
