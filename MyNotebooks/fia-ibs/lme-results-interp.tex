\section*{Linear Mixed Effects Model Analysis Interpretation}

The Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model was employed to analyze the change in brain activity in relation to the participant group (IBS vs. Control) and the mean microbiota composition. The model included random effects to account for individual variability among participants.

\subsection*{Model Results Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intercept (Control Group Baseline)}: The model's intercept, at -0.213, represents the average change in brain activity for the control group with a mean microbiota value of zero. The non-significant p-value (p = 0.093) suggests that this baseline change in brain activity is not statistically different from zero.
    
    \item \textbf{Group Effect (IBS vs. Control)}: The coefficient for the IBS group is 0.011, indicating a slight, though not statistically significant (p = 0.858), difference in brain activity change between IBS patients and healthy controls. This suggests that the change in brain activity is not significantly affected by the presence of IBS, as per the data.
    
    \item \textbf{Effect of Microbiota Mean}: A coefficient of 0.491 for the microbiota mean, with a p-value of 0.042, indicates a statistically significant positive correlation with the change in brain activity. This implies that an increase in the mean microbiota composition is associated with a larger change in brain activity.
    
    \item \textbf{Random Effects}: The model includes random intercepts for each participant, suggesting individual differences in brain activity change not captured by the fixed effects. The covariance and variability associated with the microbiota mean indicate individual variations in its effect on brain activity change.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Implications}

These results, derived from the simulated dataset, suggest that while the IBS condition itself may not significantly influence changes in brain activity, the composition of gut microbiota might have a notable impact. This finding underscores the potential role of microbiota in neurological changes associated with IBS, aligning with emerging research in the field.

\subsection*{Limitations}

It is essential to note that these results are based on simulated data and are for illustrative purposes. In real-world research, data complexities and additional variables would likely influence these outcomes.
