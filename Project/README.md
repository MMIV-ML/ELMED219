## _Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma_



## Description
Imagine that you are a group of established, successful scientists that will team up to tackle an important biomedical and medical challenge. There is an open call for research proposals under a new umbrella program entitled “Artificial intelligence and computational (bio)medicine,” where your multidisciplinary group is aiming for a project on “Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach.”

The focus of the assignment is 

1. description of relevant imaging technologies and modalities - possibly at different scales,
2. proposal of imaging-derived biomarkers for glioblastoma, 
3. machine learning techniques for segmentation, classification, treatment stratification, and prediction, 
4. the novelty and expected impact of your approach, and 
5. the evaluation of the ethics of your project, together with a data management plan (and not so much the basic science of brain tumors per se).


## Organization of your report

### Research plan
(3-5 pages incl. figures and bibliography)
 - A brief background to the field
 - Objectives and expected impact
 - Material and methods
 - Evaluation

### Data management plan and ethical considerations
(1 1/2-2 1/2 pages incl. graphics / links)
 - Description of collected/generated data and code
 - Sharing of data and code
 - Ethical considerations

-----------------------------------
## *Prepare you and your computer for the team-based project*



#### *Orient yourself in the material for the group project and how to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) for writing your report*
<!-- _Note: Details will be modified and added before the course start_ -->

- We will be using the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) online, collaborative LaTeX editor (for more information on LaTeX, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [here](https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-4/senthil/senthil.pdf) and [here](https://mildopinions.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/why-i-use-latex-in-biology), and for LeTeX templates, see e.g. [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-molecular-systems-biology/kyxgttpbzhht) and [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/academic-journal))

- **LaTeX template for the report**  is found [[here](./latex-template/ELMED219_2023_project_team_k.tex)] with a dummy figure [[here](./latex-template/elmed219_dummy_fig.png)], resulting in the following dummy report [[pdf](./latex-template/ELMED219_2023_project_team_k.pdf)].

- **Expected level of detail** is illustrated with a [project report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xwjxwcnpzhqv) from the 2019 Summer School at Seili (for which *Prostate Cancer* was the topic) to be found on Overleaf [[here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5ec71af71aca320001385354)] and in the present repo as [[main.tex](./latex-template/Seili_2020_example/main.tex)],  [[fig1](./latex-template/Seili_2020_example/Fig1_The_process_of_autoEncoder.png)], [[fig2](./latex-template/Seili_2020_example/Fig2_Overview_of_the_process.png)], resulting in the [[pdf](./latex-template/Seili_2020_example/Seili_2020_project_template.pdf)].

*Excerpt*: Considering the value of big data and the potential of publicly available datasets for increased reproducibility of scientific findings, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created TCGA ([cancergenome.nih.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)) and [TCIA](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7) (www.cancerimagingarchive.net). TCGA is a multi-institutional comprehensive collection of various molecularly characterized tumor types, and its data are available in NCI’s Genomic Data Commons portal ([gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov)). Building upon NIH’s investment in TCGA, the NCI’s Cancer Imaging Program approached sites that contributed tissue samples, to obtain corresponding de-identified routine clinically-acquired radiological data and store them in TCIA. These repositories make available multi-institutional, high-dimensional, multi-parametric data of cancer patients, allowing for radiogenomic analysis.

Task mapping predictions could give neurosurgeons the ability to visualize eloquent areas and avoid potential surgically induced deficits, even without collecting any fMRI data. Our future efforts will focus on using CNNs to provide enhanced mapping accuracy and validating the use of structural imaging to predict task activation maps in clinical populations, such as brain tumor patients._"
