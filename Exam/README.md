## Exam Format

- This is followed by **two free-text essay questions**. 

- The eight MCQ questions and the two essay questions are given in both **English**, **Norsk bokmål**, and **Norsk nynorsk**. 

- **All aids are allowed** but specify precisely which aids you have had access to and how you used these sources (look-up, search, prompt) in your submitted answers. The exam allows the use of AI to understand and explain medical AI.

- The **topics covered** in the MCQ and the two essay questions are among the following (_no coding is expected_): 

  - Multimodal data
  - Basics of Machine Learning
  - “Open science”
  - MRI technology

## Exam Rules
- For the 8 **MCQ questions** with 5 answer options each, you will get 3 points for exactly 1 correct answer, 5 points for 2 correct answers, 0 points otherwise.

- For each of the two **essay questions**, a particularly good answer is given 10 points; a particularly bad answer, or no answer, is given 0 points; each essay questions counts for 1/6 of the exam.

- The highest possible score on the complete exam is 60 points, the lowest possible score is 0 points.

- We will use the binary grading system with a **tentative threshold** of 20 points for passing the exam: 0-19 points is a fail, 20-60 is a pass (e.g. you will pass if you score at least 5 points on each of the essay questions and has at least one correct answer on at least 4 of the 8 MCQ questions; note that this is just an example, **the actual grading and threshold will be set by the course responsible**).<br>



_Side note_: The probability of getting at least 10 points on the MCQ questions **by chance** is non-negligible, i.e. try to solve:

_For each of 8 MCQ questions with 5 answer options each, 2 of the 5 options are correct. For each question, you will get 3 points for exactly 1 correct answer, 5 points for the maximum of 2 correct answers, and 0 points otherwise. What is the probability of getting 10 points or more by chance across the 8 MCQ questions?_

Please refer to the course syllabus for more detailed information about the curriculum.
